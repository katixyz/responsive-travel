            <p>
              We are Kati, 30 years old environmental geographer and Milo, 3
              years old medium poodle. We started this blog to share the
              experiences from all our adventures and to document our common
              path. Usually, we are travelling with a camper van or staying at
              dog-friendly Airbnb's. We travel all over Europe and want to see
              as many countries together as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most important thing to me is that I want you to know that I
              always report from my point of view and you should always consider
              what your dog is like and what's best for you. Even though I
              always try to assess which kind of dogs would have fun at the
              different travels or activities, in the end it is always your
              decision to make. Hopefully, you can take away a lot of valuable
              tips for your next trip or travel. Please, never hesitate to get
              in touch with us if you have any questions or different
              experiences. We love to get in touch and exchange stories with
              you!
